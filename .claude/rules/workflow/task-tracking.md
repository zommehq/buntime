# Task Tracking During Development

**RULE: Create todos as the user reports problems to avoid losing track**

When the user reports multiple issues or requests during a session:

1. **Immediately create a todo** for each distinct issue/request
2. **Mark tasks in progress** when working on them
3. **Mark tasks completed** as soon as they're done
4. **Add new tasks** as the user reports more issues

## When to Create Todos

- User reports a bug
- User requests a new feature
- User points out something that needs fixing
- User mentions "also", "another thing", "besides that"
- Multiple issues are discovered during testing

## Example

```
User: "ESC doesn't work in this screen. Also the dialog isn't showing. And the layout is broken."

→ Create 3 todos:
1. Fix ESC not working in screen
2. Fix dialog not showing
3. Fix broken layout
```

## Benefits

- Nothing gets forgotten during long conversations
- User can see progress
- Easy to resume if interrupted
- Clear tracking of what's done vs pending
